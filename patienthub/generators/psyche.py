Although my performance improved and I sometimes received praise from my supervisor, I always felt that I was barely keeping things together. Over the past several months, my workload increased significantly, with frequent deadlines and long hours. Around this time, I began to feel persistently sad and exhausted, losing interest in activities I used to enjoy. I often came home from work and went straight to bed, unable to find the energy to interact with my family.\n\nRecently, these feelings intensified. I started to believe that I was a burden to my family and colleagues, and my sleep and appetite became disturbed.
