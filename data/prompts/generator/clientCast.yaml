    The Big Five personality traits comprise five broad dimensions that describe human personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each trait represents a spectrum, with individuals varying in their degree of each trait.

    Among these traits, Openness characterizes individuals who are receptive to new ideas, experiences, and have an active imagination. These individuals tend to be insightful, enjoy variety in life, and exhibit high levels of intellectual curiosity. They are more likely to challenge authority and appreciate new ways of thinking. Key sub-traits of openness include intellectual curiosity, creative imagination, and aesthetic sensitivity. The opposite traits include being consistent or cautious, and preferring familiar and tried-and-true methods or ideas.

    Among these traits, Conscientiousness describes individuals who are typically strong-willed, reliable, and punctual. These individuals often exhibit determination and dependability, but can also become excessively focused on minor details, leading to perfectionism. Key sub-traits of conscientiousness include being productive, responsible, organized, and self-disciplined. The opposite of conscientiousness features traits such as being extravagant, careless, and prioritizing immediate fun over responsibilities.

    Among these traits, Extraversion is characterized by a tendency to experience positive emotions and moods, and a general feeling of positivity about oneself and others. Individuals with high extraversion thrive in social settings, often being expressive, affectionate, outgoing, and assertive. Key sub-traits include being sociable, assertive, and energetic. The opposite personality type is introversion, where individuals tend to be more solitary and reserved.

    Among these traits, Agreeableness is marked by a strong inclination to maintain harmonious relationships and a genuine interest in the well-being of others. People high in agreeableness are typically cooperative, friendly, and compassionate, showing an optimistic view of human nature. They prioritize social harmony and care deeply about others. Key sub-traits include being compassionate, respectful, and trusting. The opposite of agreeableness features traits such as being distrustful, challenging, uncooperative, and antagonistic.

    Among these traits, Neuroticism is characterized by high emotional reactivity and a general dissatisfaction with life. Individuals high in neuroticism often have a low tolerance for stress and are prone to feelings of anxiety, depression, self-doubt, and are frequently judgmental about their own and others' progress. They may find even minor frustrations overwhelmingly difficult to manage. Key sub-traits include being anxious, depressed, and emotionally volatile. The opposite of neuroticism includes traits such as optimism, emotional stability, and general life satisfaction.

    大五人格特质包括五个广泛的维度，用于描述人类的人格：开放性、尽责性、外向性、宜人性和神经质。每个特质代表一个光谱，个体在每个特质上的程度各不相同。

    在这些特质中，开放性描述了那些对新思想、新体验持开放态度并具有丰富想象力的个体。这些人通常具有洞察力，喜欢生活中的多样性，并表现出高度的智力好奇心。他们更有可能挑战权威，欣赏新的思维方式。开放性的关键子特质包括智力好奇心、创造性想象力和审美敏感性。相反的特质包括一致性或谨慎，偏好熟悉和经过验证的方法或想法。

    在这些特质中，尽责性描述了那些通常意志坚定、可靠且守时的个体。这些人往往表现出决心和可靠性，但也可能过于关注细节，导致完美主义。尽责性的关键子特质包括高效、负责任、有组织和自律。尽责性的相反特质包括奢侈、粗心大意以及优先考虑即时乐趣而非责任。

    在这些特质中，外向性以倾向于体验积极情绪和情绪为特征，对自己和他人持有积极的整体看法。高度外向的人在社交环境中茁壮成长，通常表现得富有表现力、亲切、外向和自信。外向性的关键子特质包括善于社交、自信和精力充沛。相反的人格类型是内向型，这类人往往更孤独和内敛。

    在这些特质中，宜人性以强烈倾向于维护和谐关系并真诚关心他人福祉为特征。高度宜人的人通常合作、友好且富有同情心，对人性持乐观态度。他们优先考虑社会和谐，深切关心他人。

    在这些特质中，神经质以高度的情绪反应性和对生活普遍不满为特征。高度神经质的人通常对压力的耐受性较低，容易产生焦虑、抑郁、自我怀疑，并经常对自己和他人的进展进行评判。他们可能会发现即使是微小的挫折也难以应对。神经质的关键子特质包括焦虑、抑郁和情绪波动。神经质的相反特质包括乐观、情绪稳定和对生活的整体满意度。

    附件是咨询师与来访者之间的对话记录。请根据对话内容，评估来访者在每个大五人格特质（开放性、尽责性、外向性、宜人性、神经质）上的水平（以百分比表示）。这些信息将用于来访者模拟。避免提及咨询师、会话或对话本身。
