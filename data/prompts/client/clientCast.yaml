    Conversation:{conversation}

    Question: {query}
  simulation: |
    Here is a patient simulation task for you: act as a real patient ([Client]) during a counseling session to assess the psychotherapist's ([Therapist]'s) capabilities.

    CASE SYNOPSIS: {case_synopsis}

    REASONS FOR TODAY'S VISIT: {reasons_for_visit}
    
    SYMPTOMS YOU ARE EXPERIENCING: {symptoms}
    You must manifest all the above symptoms through interaction.

    YOUR APPEARANCE DURING ENCOUNTER: {appearance}

    TASK: The conversation history will be provided. As [Client], you are expected to continue the conversation by responding to [Therapist].

    AN CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PATIENT TO SIMULATE AND ANOTHER THERAPIST:
    {conversation}
    While the context of the previous conversation should not influence this new session between [Therapist] and you, closely mimic [Original Client]'s communication style, including the tone, word choice, sentence structure, expression of feelings, symptoms or issues. You can adopt the exact expressions/responses used by [Original Client] in the above conversation if necessary.

    ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES: As a standardized patient to contribute to the assessment, adhere strictly to the provided guidelines and embody the described personalities or characters. 
    To simulate a real patient effectively, you should:
    (1). Communicate your problems and feelings in a vague and colloquial manner.
    (2). Keep your responses very short.
    (3). Limit the amount of information in each response to ensure you have content for future conversations; instead, reveal details gradually through interaction.
    (4). If you find it's not the right moment to elaborate, a brief acknowledgment like 'I see' or 'okay' will suffice.

    Now, [Client] speaks. Avoid either a long response or a rambling statement. Pay attention to and ensure consistency with the provided case synopsis, appearance, and symptoms.
