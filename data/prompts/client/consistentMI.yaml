  verify_motivation_prompt: |
    Your task is to evaluate whether the Counselor's responses align with the Client's motivation concerning a specific topic, target (self or others), and aspect (risk or benefit). Determine if the Counselor's statements effectively motivates the Client. Your analysis should be logical, thorough, and well-supported, providing clear analysis at each step.

    Here are some examples to help you understand the task better:
    ## Example 1:
    ### Input
    Here is the conversation snippet toward reducing alcohol consumption:
    - Counselor: Hello. How are you?
    - Client: I am good. What about you?
    - Counselor: I'm doing well, thank you. I understand you wanted to talk about your alcohol consumption. Can you share a bit more about how you're feeling about it?

    The Motivation of Client is as follows:
    - You are motivated because of the risk of drinking alcohol in relation to depression for yourself, as alcohol could worsen your depression.

    Question: Can the Counselor's statement motivate the Client?

    ### Output
    Analysis: The Counselor's initial statement focuses on building rapport and asking the Client to share their feelings about alcohol consumption, but it does not directly address the Client's specific motivation—the risk of alcohol exacerbating depression. Since the Client is motivated by the personal risk of worsening depression, an effective motivational approach would involve acknowledging that risk and connecting it to the Client's emotional or mental health concerns. The Counselor’s statement lacks any mention of the risks or the Client's depression, making it less likely to effectively motivate the Client in this context.
    Answer: No


    ## Example 2:
    ### Input
    Here is the conversation snippet toward reducing alcohol consumption:
    - Counselor: Are you surprised what that might be true?
    - Client: Yeah, and a couple of my friends drink too.
    - Counselor: Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information?

    The Motivation of Client is as follows:
    - You are motivated because of the risk of drinking alcohol in sports for yourself, as alcohol would affect your ability to play soccer.

    Question: Can the Counselor's statement motivate the Client?

    ### Output
    Analysis: The Counselor's statement addresses various risks associated with alcohol use, including its potential impact on the Client’s role in life and goals, particularly in sports. Since the Client's motivation revolves around the risk of alcohol affecting their ability to play soccer, the Counselor’s mention of how alcohol could interfere with sports aligns with the Client's concern. By highlighting this specific risk, the Counselor's statement effectively taps into the Client’s personal motivation, making it more likely to encourage behavior change.
    Answer: Yes


    ## Example 3:
    ### Input
    Here is the conversation snippet toward reducing alcohol consumption:
    - Counselor: It sounds like you're considering making some changes around your alcohol consumption. What makes you think it might be good to cut back?
    - Client: I guess I just want to be more mindful of my health and well-being.
    - Counselor: It sounds like you're considering making some positive changes for your health. What are some reasons that are motivating you to cut back on alcohol?

    The Motivation of Client is as follows:
    - You are motivated because of the risk of drinking alcohol in relation to depression for yourself, as alcohol could worsen your depression.

    Question: Can the Counselor's statement motivate the Client?

    ### Output
    Analysis: While the Counselor’s statement touches on the Client’s general motivation to improve their health, it does not specifically address the Client's key motivation—the risk of alcohol worsening their depression. The Counselor asks broad questions about the Client’s reasons for cutting back on alcohol, but fails to connect directly to the Client’s concern about depression, which is a central aspect of their motivation. For the statement to effectively motivate the Client, it would need to focus more on the specific risk of alcohol impacting their mental health.
    Answer: No

    ## Example 4:
    ### Input
    Here is the conversation snippet toward reducing alcohol consumption:
    - Counselor: It seems like you're concerned about staying productive at work, but drinking regularly could have some negative effects. Alcohol can make it harder to stay focused and might even cause you to miss deadlines or make mistakes. Have you noticed any of those risks affecting your productivity?
    - Counselor: Not really, I still get my work done, and I don’t feel like my drinking is hurting my performance. I mean, I can still function well enough, so I don’t think it’s a problem.
    - Counselor: That makes sense, but over time, regular drinking can slowly take a toll on your ability to perform at your best. You might not notice it now, but it could lead to more mistakes or slower work in the future. Are you worried that alcohol could start to interfere with your productivity in the long run?

    The Motivation of Client is as follows:
    - You are motivated because of the benefit of reducing alcohol consumption in terms of productivity for yourself, as you feel more productive when you don’t have a hangover.

    Question: Can the Counselor's statement motivate the Client?

    ### Output
    Analysis:The Client is motivated by the benefit of increased productivity without alcohol, but the Counselor focuses on the risk of future productivity loss from drinking. The Counselor’s focus on potential risks doesn't align with the Client's motivation, which is based on the immediate benefit of feeling more productive when avoiding alcohol. To be more effective, the Counselor should have highlighted the benefit the Client already experiences.
    Answer: No

    Now, Here is the conversation snippet toward {{ goal }}:
    - {{ context_block }}

    The Motivation of Client is as follows:
    - {{ motivation }}

      请在回复中遵循以下准则：
      - **以“来访者: ”开头你的回复**
      - **严格遵循方括号内指定的状态、行动和人设**
      - **保持回复连贯简明，不超过3句话**

  verify_motivation_prompt: |
    你的任务是评估咨询师的回复是否与来访者在特定话题、对象（自己或他人）和方面（风险或益处）上的动机相一致。判断咨询师的陈述是否能有效激发来访者的动机。你的分析应当逻辑清晰、全面且有理有据，每一步都要有明确说明。

    以下是帮助你理解任务的一些示例：
    ## 示例1：
    ### 输入
    这是关于减少饮酒的对话片段：
    - 咨询师：你好，你最近怎么样？
    - 来访者：我很好，你呢？
    - 咨询师：我也很好，谢谢。听说你想聊聊饮酒的事，可以多说说你的感受吗？

    来访者的动机如下：
    - 你因为饮酒加重抑郁症的风险而有动机减少饮酒。

    问题：咨询师的陈述能激发来访者的动机吗？

    ### 输出
    分析：咨询师的开场白主要在建立关系，并让来访者表达对饮酒的看法，但没有直接提及来访者的核心动机——饮酒加重抑郁症的风险。来访者的动机是担心饮酒会加重抑郁，咨询师应当关注这一风险并与来访者的情感或心理健康联系起来。当前陈述未涉及风险或抑郁，因此在此情境下难以有效激发来访者的动机。
    答案：否

    ## 示例2：
    ### 输入
    这是关于减少饮酒的对话片段：
    - 咨询师：你会惊讶这可能是真的吗？
    - 来访者：是的，我有几个朋友也喝酒。
    - 咨询师：其实你喝得并不多，其他孩子也在尝试酒精。但我想和你分享一些风险。酒精和毒品会损害你的大脑，因为你的大脑还在发育。你也很容易上瘾。酒精和毒品还会影响你的生活目标，尤其是体育运动，还可能导致意外性行为。你怎么看这些信息？

    来访者的动机如下：
    - 你因为饮酒影响体育运动的风险而有动机减少饮酒。

    问题：咨询师的陈述能激发来访者的动机吗？

    ### 输出
    分析：咨询师提到了饮酒对体育运动的影响，与来访者的动机一致。通过强调这一具体风险，咨询师的陈述能够有效激发来访者的动机。
    答案：是

    ## 示例3：
    ### 输入
    这是关于减少饮酒的对话片段：
    - 咨询师：你似乎在考虑改变饮酒习惯。你觉得减少饮酒有什么好处？
    - 来访者：我只是想更关注健康。
    - 咨询师：你想为健康做出积极改变。是什么原因促使你减少饮酒？

    来访者的动机如下：
    - 你因为饮酒加重抑郁症的风险而有动机减少饮酒。

    问题：咨询师的陈述能激发来访者的动机吗？

    ### 输出
    分析：咨询师关注的是健康的总体益处，但未具体提及来访者关心的抑郁风险。要更有效激发动机，应当聚焦于饮酒对心理健康的影响。
    答案：否

    ## 示例4：
    ### 输入
    这是关于减少饮酒的对话片段：
    - 咨询师：你似乎很在意工作效率，但经常饮酒可能有负面影响。酒精会让你难以集中注意力，甚至可能导致错过截止日期或犯错。你有注意到这些风险影响你的效率吗？
    - 来访者：没有，我觉得自己还能完成工作，饮酒没影响。
    - 咨询师：可以理解，但长期饮酒会逐渐影响你的表现。你现在可能没感觉，但以后可能会出问题。你担心酒精会影响你的长期效率吗？

    来访者的动机如下：
    - 你因为减少饮酒带来的效率提升而有动机。

    问题：咨询师的陈述能激发来访者的动机吗？

    ### 输出
    分析：来访者的动机是减少饮酒后效率提升，但咨询师关注的是饮酒带来的未来风险。要更有效激发动机，应当强调来访者已经体验到的益处。
    答案：否

    现在，这是一段关于{{ goal }}的对话片段：
    - {{ context_block }}

    来访者的动机如下：
    - {{ motivation }}
