            "feedback": "The character Sarah has a realistic portrayal of a person with social anxiety disorder. The symptoms being of moderate severity over several years point to longstanding issues, which is plausible as anxiety disorders often begin in adolescence or early adulthood. Her avoidance strategies are typical of someone struggling with this issue, though she still engages in activities like photography which shows some efforts to cope or express herself. Her traits like perfectionism and overthinking align well with social anxiety. One thing that could improve realism is considering how social anxiety might affect her photography interest - she might have trouble photographing strangers or might only feel comfortable editing photos digitally instead of interacting with others through photography. The living situation with roommates is realistic given her age and student status, but it might create additional challenges if she avoids socializing with them too. Adding more specific details about her academic field might strengthen consistency.",
            "suggestions": [
                "Include how her social anxiety affects her photography - is it a form of escape or does it cause its own challenges? If she photographs people, how does that interact with her anxiety?",
                "Think about consistency of traits - her being empathetic might seem contradictory with her avoiding people. Is there a way to reconcile this in her expression? Perhaps she cares about people but feels overwhelmed being around them?"
