But maybe they want more than just the number? Maybe they're testing if I know simple arithmetic. I should confirm the answer and maybe add a friendly note. Let me check if there's any context I'm missing. The user didn't specify any special conditions, so it's safe to assume standard addition. Alright, the answer is 2. I'll present that clearly and offer further help in case they have more questions.\n",
