        "summary": "The therapist demonstrated a basic understanding of CBT principles, effectively identifying automatic thoughts related to the client's academic stress. However, the session lacked depth in exploring core beliefs and employing structured cognitive restructuring techniques. The therapist encouraged client reflection and initial reframing but could improve by setting more collaborative and specific homework tasks. More nuanced use of Socratic questioning could enhance client engagement with the cognitive model.",
