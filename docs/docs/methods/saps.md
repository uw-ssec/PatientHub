# SAPS

> Automatic Interactive Evaluation for Large Language Models with State Aware Patient Simulator

**Venue**: ArXiv  
**Paper**: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08495)

## Overview

SAPS focuses on clinical consultation, where the agent role-plays based on real hospital cases to assess whether the doctor can accurately diagnose the condition.   
SAPS introduces State Tracking and Memory Bank mechanisms, forcing the patient simulator to decide "how much information to give" or "whether to refuse to answer" based strictly on the doctor's performance.

## Key Features

It uses specific Prompts to judge in three stages:  

1. **Broad Category (Stage I)**: Classify the doctor's questions into Inquiry, Advice, Demand, Other Topic or End
2. **Specificity (Stage II)**: Determine the question is specific or broad
3. **Relevance (Stage III)**: Extract relevant information from the complete medical record  

Based on the final state obtained by the State Tracker, SAPS selects the corresponding **state_instruction prompt** to generate the patient response.

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
uv run python -m examples.simulate client=saps therapist=user
```

## Configuration

| Option      | Description            | Default                             |
