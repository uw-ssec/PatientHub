> Eeyore: Realistic Depression Simulation via Expert-in-the-Loop Supervised and Preference Optimization

**Venue**: ACL 2025 (Findings)  
**Paper**: [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.707/)

## Overview

Eeyore introduce a Structured Alignment Framework that incorporates human experts. The framework contains three stages: data curation, instruction tuning, and preference optimization. It aims to create realistic simulations of individuals experiencing depression. 

## Key Features

- **Data Curation**: Mined real-world depression-related conversations from public sources 
> (e.g., depression subreddits, counseling transcripts)
- **Psychological Profile Construction**: A detailed structured profile containing different dimensions (DSM-V standards and Beck's cognitive theory)
- **Instruction Tuning & DPO**: To align the model closer to clinical expert expectations

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
uv run python -m examples.simulate client=eeyore therapist=user
```

### Python

```python
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
from patienthub.clients import get_client

config = OmegaConf.create({
    'agent_type': 'eeyore',
    'model_type': 'LOCAL',
    'model_name': 'hosted_vllm//data3/public_checkpoints/huggingface_models/Eeyore_llama3.1_8B',
    'temperature': 0.7,
    'max_tokens': 1024,
    'max_retries': 3,
    'data_path': 'data/characters/Eeyore.json',
    'data_idx': 0,
})

client = get_client(configs=config, lang='en')
client.set_therapist({'name': 'Clinician'})

response = client.generate_response("How have you been sleeping lately?")
print(response.content)
```
> ⚠️ **Hint:**  
> - Start a local OpenAI-compatible model server (e.g., vLLM) to serve the weights.  
> - Set `LOCAL_BASE_URL`; PatientHub passes them as `api_base/api_key` to LiteLLM.  
> - Use `model_type=LOCAL` and set `model_name` to your served model id/name.  
> - Run: `uv run python -m examples.simulate client=eeyore therapist=user`

## Example Conversation

**Clinician**: "Hi Sam, thank you for coming in. How have you been feeling lately?"

**Patient (Eeyore)**: "_sighs_ I don't know... just tired, I guess. Everything feels like such an effort. Even getting out of bed this morning took everything I had."

**Clinician**: "It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fatigue. How long has this been going on?"

**Patient**: "Months now. I used to love going to yoga, seeing friends... now I can't remember the last time I did either. What's the point, really?"

**Clinician**: "You mentioned you used to enjoy yoga and seeing friends. What changed?"

**Patient**: "I lost my job back in March. I keep telling myself I'll start applying for new ones, but every time I sit down to work on my resume, I just... can't. I stare at the screen and think, 'Why would anyone hire me anyway?'"
