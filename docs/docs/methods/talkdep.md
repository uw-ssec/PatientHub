# TalkDep

> Clinically Grounded LLM Personas for Conversation-Centric Depression Screening

**Venue**: CIKM 2025  
**Paper**: [ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3746252.3761617)

## Overview

TalkDep creates clinically grounded personas for depression screening research. Each persona has a specific BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) score, depression level, and detailed symptom profiles, making it ideal for training and evaluating depression screening conversational agents.

## Key Features

- **BDI-II**: Strictly constructed based on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).
- **BDI-Grounded**: By using pre-defined BDI-II scores as a ground truth to evaluate and quantify the performance of the simulation.
- **Validated Personas**: Constructed 12 validated depression personas, covering four severity levels: Minimal, Mild, Moderate, and Severe.

## How It Works

1. **Profile Loading**: Loads persona with BDI score and symptom profiles
2. **System Prompt Construction**: Builds prompt incorporating all persona details
3. **Conversation Handling**: Maintains conversation history for context
4. **Response Generation**: Generates responses following linguistic patterns and behavioral constraints

## Depression Levels

TalkDep personas span the full range of depression severity:

| BDI Score | Depression Level    | Characteristics                                    |
| --------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-9       | Minimal Depression  | Generally positive, occasional stress              |
| 10-18     | Mild Depression     | Concentration issues, irritability, sleep problems |
| 19-29     | Moderate Depression | Persistent sadness, social withdrawal              |
| 30-63     | Severe Depression   | Significant impairment, possible suicidal ideation |

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
uv run python -m examples.simulate client=talkDep therapist=user
```

### Python

```python
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
from patienthub.clients import get_client

config = OmegaConf.create({
    'agent_type': 'talkDep',
    'model_type': 'OPENAI',
    'model_name': 'gpt-4o',
    'temperature': 0.7,
    'max_tokens': 1024,
    'max_retries': 3,
    'data_path': 'data/characters/talkDep.json',
    'data_idx': 0,
})

client = get_client(configs=config, lang='en')
client.set_therapist({'name': 'Clinician'})

response = client.generate_response("How have you been feeling lately?")
print(response.content)
```

## Configuration

| Option      | Description            | Default                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `data_path` | Path to character file | `data/characters/talkDep.json` |
| `data_idx`  | Character index        | `0`                            |
