# ClientCast

> Towards a Client-Centered Assessment of LLM Therapists by Client Simulation

**Venue**: ArXiv  
**Paper**: [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12266)

## Overview

ClientCast creates client simulations for assessing LLM-based therapists. It introduces well-designed and detailed psychological profiles including Big Five personality traits, symptom assessments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, OQ-45), and conversation history from real therapy sessions to create realistic client behavior.

## Key Features

- **Deep Psychological Profiling**: Models Big Five personality traits alongside critical therapy-relevant traits like resistance and emotional fluctuation.
- **Symptom Assessment**: Grounded in validated scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, OQ-45).
- **Real Conversation Grounding**: Uses human therapy conversation excerpts
- **Client-Centered Focus**: Enables the simulated client to evaluate the therapist

## How It Works

1. **Profile Construction**: Builds case synopsis from basic profile
2. **Symptom Integration**: Incorporates identified symptoms with severity levels
3. **Personality Mapping**: Uses Big Five traits to guide response style
4. **Conversation Grounding**: References real therapy conversation excerpts
5. **Response Generation**: Produces responses consistent with profile and conversation context

## Psychological Scales

ClientCast integrates multiple validated assessment instruments:

| Scale | Description                        | Focus               |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| PHQ-9 | Patient Health Questionnaire       | Depression symptoms |
| GAD-7 | Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale | Anxiety symptoms    |
| OQ-45 | Outcome Questionnaire              | Overall functioning |

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
uv run python -m examples.simulate client=clientCast therapist=CBT
```

### Python

```python
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
from patienthub.clients import get_client

config = OmegaConf.create({
    'agent_type': 'clientCast',
    'model_type': 'OPENAI',
    'model_name': 'gpt-4o',
    'temperature': 0.7,
    'max_tokens': 1024,
    'max_retries': 3,
    'data_path': 'data/characters/ClientCast.json',
    'conv_path': 'data/resources/ClientCast/human_data.json',
    'symptoms_path': 'data/resources/ClientCast/symptoms.json',
    'data_idx': 0,
    'conv_id': 0,
})

client = get_client(configs=config, lang='en')
client.set_therapist({'name': 'Therapist'})

response = client.generate_response("What brings you in today?")
print(response.content)
```

| `conv_id`       | Conversation excerpt ID     | `0`                                         |
